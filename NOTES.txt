TODO:
    Make altars functional. Maintain a list of every altar core in each world, as well as a hash map of every powered block in the world with it's connected altar.
    Add looting functionality to Arthana.
    Make Kettle (add recipe for Redstone Soup)
    Make Hobgoblins (Koboldite mineral items already implemented)
    Add all brewing effects
    Add distillers
    Add all cauldron recipes.
    Add particle effects for altars.
    Stockade damage behavior is inaccurate. Damage is taken while walking, not while falling. Maybe keep the falling damage, but add walking damage too.
    Double check Aldar door redstone behavior. Power is applied only to the block below and redstone next to the door.
    Make attuned stone texture recolored modern diamond?
    Altar behavior is techincally inaccurate. Placing another altar next to a joined altar should un-join it, but this doesn't happen.
