TODO:
    Try to reduce amount of data stored in BlockEntity NBT.
        WitchsOvenEntity stores fumeChance, even though they can just check the relevant blocks when a material is smelted.
    Add looting functionality to Arthana.
    Make Kettle (add recipe for Redstone Soup)
    Make Hobgoblins (Koboldite mineral items already implemented)
    Add all brewing effects
    Add distillers
    Add all cauldron recipes.
    Add particle effects for altars.
    Stockade damage behavior is inaccurate. Damage is taken while walking, not while falling.
        Maybe keep the falling damage, but add walking damage too.
